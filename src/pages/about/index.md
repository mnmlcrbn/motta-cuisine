In the Fall of 2016 MC closed its doors for 6 months while Chef Motta mourned the loss of his father Robert W. Motta.



Recently relocating home to St. Croix Chef Motta relaunched MC in the Spring of 2017. The brands connection to the history and culture of the islands made the transition effortless. Chef Motta's style can be described as a fusion of Caribbean, French and American cuisine.
